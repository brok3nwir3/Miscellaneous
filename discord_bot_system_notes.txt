Linux System Notes

When using system files, instead of manual screens, user this command to check bot statuses:
journalctl -u discord-general -f

Create two services files:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/discord-news.service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/discord-general.service

Note, the contents of the two files can be found in this GitHub directory.

Run these commands to start your two bot services:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable discord-general
sudo systemctl enable discord-news
sudo systemctl start discord-general
sudo systemctl start discord-news
