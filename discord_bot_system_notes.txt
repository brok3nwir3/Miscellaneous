Linux System Notes

These steps allow you to auto-start the discord bot/s when the system launches.

1) Check the the service files: discord-general.service and discord-news.service
2) Edit the service files if needed. For example, if the username needs to change.

3) Create two services files:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/discord-news.service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/discord-general.service

4) Run these commands to start your two bot services:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable discord-general
sudo systemctl enable discord-news
sudo systemctl start discord-general
sudo systemctl start discord-news

NOTE:
When using system files, instead of manual screens, user this command to check bot statuses:
journalctl -u discord-general -f
